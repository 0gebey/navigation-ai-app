## 2023-11-03: TypeScript Fixes & Voice Service Implementation

### TypeScript Fixes

Fixed type errors across multiple components:

1. **AppNavigator.tsx**:

   - Added proper typing for navigation stack parameters
   - Created RootStackParamList type for navigation routes
   - Fixed type errors with PlaceDetailScreen

2. **MapScreen.tsx**:

   - Added PointOfInterest interface for POI data
   - Fixed state type definitions for location, error messages, and current POI
   - Added proper typing for Location objects

3. **PlacesScreen.tsx**:

   - Created Place interface for place data
   - Added Category interface for filtering categories
   - Fixed implicit any types in renderItem functions

4. **ProfileScreen.tsx**:
   - Created User, Trip, and Setting interfaces
   - Added SettingsSection interface for structured settings
   - Fixed type errors in render functions

### Voice Service Implementation **(Mock Implementation)**

Created a new VoiceService for text-to-speech functionality:

- Implemented using the Singleton pattern for global access
- Added EventEmitter for event-based communication
- Created methods for:
  - Speaking text with configurable options (mock implementation using timeouts)
  - Narrating place information (integrates with mock AIService)
  - Generating approaching narratives (integrates with mock AIService)
  - Controlling playback (pause, resume, stop) (mock implementation)
  - Configuring voice options (mock implementation)
- Added integration with AIService for content generation
- Implemented mock functionality to simulate audio playback with timeouts
- Added error handling for narration failures

## 2023-11-04: Expo Best Practices Alignment

After reviewing the Expo documentation, we've confirmed that our project follows several key Expo best practices:

### What We're Doing Right

- **TypeScript Integration**: We're properly using TypeScript as recommended in the Expo documentation, with appropriate type definitions for our components.
- **Project Structure**: Our structure follows Expo recommendations with clear separation of screens, components, and services.
- **Navigation Implementation**: We're using React Navigation for routing, which aligns with Expo's recommendations for navigation.
- **Expo Native Modules**: We've prepared for integration with Expo modules like Location (already used) and will integrate with Expo Speech for real TTS implementation.

### Areas for Improvement

1. **File-Based Routing**: Expo recommends file-based routing with Expo Router, while we're using the more traditional component-based React Navigation. Consider migrating to Expo Router in the future for better deep-linking support and simplified navigation code.

2. **Development Builds**: We should set up Expo Development builds for testing on actual devices with full native capabilities.

3. **EAS Update Configuration**: We should prepare the app for over-the-air updates using EAS Update, which will allow us to push content updates without app store review.

4. **App Configuration**: We need to properly configure app.json with all required metadata for builds and submission.

### Action Items for Expo Best Practices

1. **Set up ESLint and Prettier**: Add proper code formatting and linting as recommended by Expo.
2. **Configure app.json**: Update with proper app metadata, icons, and splash screen.
3. **Implement proper error boundaries**: Add global error handling for production.
4. **Set up EAS Build and EAS Update**: Configure for CI/CD and OTA updates.
5. **Consider Expo Router**: Evaluate benefits of migrating to file-based routing.

## Features Status

### Implemented with Real Functionality:

- Basic navigation structure
- UI components and screens
- TypeScript integration and type safety
- Event-based architecture

### Implemented as Mocks (Need Real Implementation):

- AI content generation (currently using predefined data)
- Voice narration/text-to-speech (currently simulated with timeouts)
- Real-time location-based triggers (currently using simulated events)
- Map route planning (currently using static route data)

## Next Steps

1. **Audio Implementation**:

   - Replace mock VoiceService with real text-to-speech using Expo Speech or Expo AV
   - Add real audio controls and UI feedback
   - Implement proper audio session management

2. **Map Enhancements**:

   - Implement real route planning with directions API
   - Add custom markers for POIs
   - Implement actual turn-by-turn navigation

3. **Content Generation**:

   - Replace mock AIService with real AI API integration (OpenAI, Google AI)
   - Expand place database with real data
   - Implement dynamic content generation

4. **UI/UX Improvements**:

   - Add loading states
   - Implement error handling UI
   - Enhance animations and transitions

5. **Expo-Specific Improvements**:
   - Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality
   - Configure app.json with proper metadata
   - Set up EAS Build and EAS Update
   - Evaluate benefits of migrating to Expo Router
