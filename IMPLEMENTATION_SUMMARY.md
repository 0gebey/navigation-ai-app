# Map App - Implementation Summary

## Implemented Features

### Core Framework

- ✅ Expo Router for navigation with tabs
- ✅ Map screen with user location tracking
- ✅ Places of interest listing with categories
- ✅ Place details screen with tabbed content
- ✅ Settings screen with preferences

### Services

- ✅ AIService for place information (currently mock implementation)
- ✅ LocationService for tracking and proximity detection
- ✅ LangchainService integration with OpenAI for enhanced AI features

### Screens

- ✅ Map screen (`app/(tabs)/index.tsx`)
- ✅ Places discovery screen (`app/(tabs)/places.tsx`)
- ✅ Settings screen (`app/(tabs)/settings.tsx`)
- ✅ Place details screen (`app/place/[name].tsx`)

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Environment Setup

- [ ] Create an actual `.env` file following the `.env.example` template
- [ ] Add sample image assets in the assets folder
- [ ] Setup proper Expo configuration in app.json

### 2. Core Feature Implementation

- [ ] Implement distance-based POI triggering
- [ ] Add notification UI when approaching a POI
- [ ] Connect navigation buttons to native map app

### 3. AI Integration

- [ ] Implement OpenAI API key configuration in settings
- [ ] Connect LangchainService to generate real place descriptions
- [ ] Create cache system for AI-generated content

### 4. User Experience

- [ ] Implement persistent settings storage
- [ ] Add loading states and transitions between screens
- [ ] Improve offline support

## Technical Improvements Needed

### API Integration

The app currently uses mock data with predefined place information. To make this a real-world application, we need to:

1. Replace AIService's mock database with actual API calls to LangchainService
2. Implement a caching layer to store API responses
3. Add error handling and retry logic for network failures

### Location and Map Features

Current location tracking is implemented, but to enhance the map experience:

1. Add custom map styling based on time of day or user preferences
2. Implement real-time route planning with turn-by-turn directions
3. Add distance-based POI detection with proper notifications

### State Management

As the app grows, better state management will be necessary:

1. Consider implementing React Context for global state (user preferences, location, etc.)
2. Add persistent storage for user settings and cached content
3. Create proper loading and error states for all API calls

## Running the Application

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file with your API keys based on `.env.example`

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npx expo start
```

## Known Issues

1. LangchainService requires an OpenAI API key to function fully
2. Image assets are currently placeholders and need to be replaced
3. The app requires image assets to be placed in `assets/images/`
