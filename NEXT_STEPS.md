# Next Steps for Map App Development

This document outlines the key tasks and implementation details for continuing the development of our Map App.

## 1. Core Functionality Enhancements

### Real-Time Location Based POI Detection

- Implement distance-based triggering of POIs using the LocationService
- Add notification when user approaches a point of interest
- Create visual indicators on the map for nearby POIs

### Navigation Integration

- Implement turn-by-turn navigation using the device's native maps app
- Add support for saving and loading custom routes
- Create an interface for choosing transportation modes (walking, driving, cycling)

### Map Styling and UI Polish

- Implement custom map styles for different times of day
- Add animated transitions between screens
- Improve markers with custom icons and callouts

## 2. AI Integration with LangChain.js

### Configure OpenAI API Integration

- Set up environment variables for API keys
- Implement secure key management for production
- Create fallback content for when API is unavailable

### Dynamic Content Generation

- Use LangchainService to generate location-based narrations
- Create AI-powered audio tour scripts
- Implement personalized recommendations based on user preferences

### Prompt Engineering

- Refine prompts for better AI-generated content
- Create templates for different content types (historical, cultural, practical)
- Optimize token usage for cost efficiency

## 3. User Experience Improvements

### Offline Support

- Implement caching of AI-generated content
- Add support for offline maps
- Create a queue system for API requests when offline

### User Preferences

- Create a settings screen for preferences
- Implement customization options (language, content types, map styles)
- Add accessibility features

### Onboarding Flow

- Design and implement a first-time user experience
- Create educational tooltips for key features
- Add sample routes and POIs for new users

## 4. Technical Infrastructure

### State Management

- Implement proper state management (Context API or Redux)
- Create custom hooks for common operations
- Optimize re-renders and performance

### Testing

- Add unit tests for core services
- Implement integration tests for AI features
- Create UI tests for critical user flows

### Performance Optimization

- Profile and optimize render performance
- Implement lazy loading for map assets
- Optimize battery usage during navigation

## 5. Advanced Features

### Social Features

- Add ability to share routes and POIs
- Implement user reviews and ratings for places
- Create a community-driven content system

### Augmented Reality

- Research AR integration possibilities
- Create simple AR view for POIs
- Implement AR navigation arrows

### Voice Interface

- Add voice commands for hands-free operation
- Implement voice search for places
- Create voice-driven navigation instructions

## Implementation Details

### LangChain.js Integration

```typescript
// Example of using LangChain for dynamic content
import { LangchainService } from "../services/LangchainService";

// Generate location-based narration
const narration = await LangchainService.generateLocationNarration(
  "Nuenen",
  2.5,
  {
    style: "storyteller",
    includeHistory: true,
  }
);

// Get deeper insights about a place
const insights = await LangchainService.getPlaceInsights("Nuenen");
```

### Google Maps Integration

```typescript
// Example of using Google Maps for navigation
import { Linking } from "react-native";

// Open Google Maps with directions
const openGoogleMapsDirections = (destination: string) => {
  const url = `https://www.google.com/maps/dir/?api=1&destination=${encodeURIComponent(
    destination
  )}`;
  Linking.openURL(url);
};
```

### LocationService Usage

```typescript
// Example of using the LocationService for proximity detection
import LocationService from "../services/LocationService";

// Listen for nearby places
LocationService.on("placeNearby", ({ place, distance }) => {
  console.log(
    `You are approaching ${place.name}, ${distance.toFixed(2)}km away`
  );
  // Trigger notification or UI update
});

// Start tracking location
await LocationService.startLocationTracking();
```

## Required Resources

- OpenAI API key for LangChain.js integration
- Google Maps API key (optional, for Google Maps provider)
- Sample POI data for testing and development
- UI/UX design mockups for advanced features
