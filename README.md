# Map App - Interactive Navigation Experience

A React Native application built with Expo that provides an interactive navigation experience with points of interest, real-time location tracking, and AI-powered narration.

## Features

- üìç Real-time location tracking
- üó∫Ô∏è Interactive map interface
- üèõÔ∏è Points of interest with detailed information
- üó£Ô∏è AI-powered narration about places
- üì± Cross-platform (iOS and Android)
- üß≠ Mapbox integration for custom maps and directions

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

2. **Configure Mapbox (Required for Mapbox features)**

   The app uses Mapbox for certain map features. To enable these features:

   a. Create a Mapbox account at https://www.mapbox.com/ and obtain an access token

   b. Add your Mapbox access token to the `app.json` file:

   ```json
   "extra": {
     // other configuration
     "mapboxAccessToken": "YOUR_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN"
   }
   ```

   c. For development builds, add the following to the plugins section in `app.json`:

   ```json
   "plugins": [
     // other plugins
     [
       "@rnmapbox/maps",
       {
         "RNMapboxMapsVersion": "11.8.0",
         "RNMapboxMapsDownloadToken": "sk.YOUR_DOWNLOAD_TOKEN"
       }
     ]
   ]
   ```

   Note: The download token requires the `DOWNLOADS:READ` scope. See [Mapbox plugin documentation](https://github.com/rnmapbox/maps/blob/main/plugin/install.md) for details.

3. **Start the development server**

```bash
npx expo start
```

4. **Run on iOS Simulator**

```bash
npx expo start --ios
```

5. **Run on Android Emulator**

```bash
npx expo start --android
```
