# TravelGuide - AI-Powered Navigation App

An AI-powered navigation app built with React Native and Expo that enhances travel experiences by providing cultural, historical, and touristic information about points of interest along your route.

## Project Vision

This app aims to transform ordinary journeys into enriching experiences by automatically providing information about significant places as users travel. For example, if a user is traveling from Helmond to Eindhoven and passes by Nuenen, the app will automatically highlight its significance as the place where Vincent van Gogh lived and worked.

## Features Roadmap

- [x] Basic map integration with navigation capabilities
- [x] User location tracking and route planning (_mock route data_)
- [x] Points of interest (POI) database integration (_mock data_)
- [x] Proximity-based content triggering system (_mock events_)
- [x] AI-generated information about locations (_mock data_)
- [x] Audio narration of place information (_mock implementation_)
- [x] User preference settings
- [ ] Offline content caching
- [ ] Social features (share discoveries, ratings)
- [ ] Monetization strategy implementation

### Implementation Status

#### Real Implementations:

- Navigation framework with React Navigation
- UI components and screens
- TypeScript integration and type checking
- Base architecture of services

#### Mock Implementations (To Be Replaced):

- **AIService**: Currently uses predefined content instead of real AI
- **VoiceService**: Uses timeouts to simulate speech instead of real text-to-speech
- **LocationService**: Uses sample POI data and simulated proximity events
- **Route Planning**: Uses static route data instead of real routing API

### Setup Phase

- [x] Created project using Expo with TypeScript template
- [x] Set up project structure with navigation, screens, and services
- [x] Implemented MapScreen with navigation interface
- [x] Added PlacesScreen for discovering POIs
- [x] Created ProfileScreen for user settings
- [x] Implemented AIService for content generation (_mock implementation_)
- [x] Implemented LocationService for tracking and proximity detection (_partially mocked_)
- [x] Implemented VoiceService for text-to-speech functionality (_mock implementation_)
- [x] Added README for documentation
- [x] Added Development Log for tracking progress

## Expo Integration & Best Practices

We're building this app with Expo to leverage its powerful React Native toolchain and simplified development workflow. Following Expo best practices ensures our app will be maintainable, performant, and easy to deploy.

### Current Expo Implementation

- **TypeScript Integration**: Full TypeScript support with proper type checking
- **Expo Modules**: Using Expo Location for user positioning
- **Navigation**: React Navigation for app routing
- **Environment Setup**: Standard Expo development environment

### Expo Development Roadmap

1. **Add Expo Speech Module**: Integrate for real text-to-speech functionality
2. **Configure app.json**: Set up proper metadata for builds and app store submission
3. **Set up ESLint & Prettier**: Implement code quality tools as recommended by Expo
4. **Implement EAS Build & Update**: Set up continuous deployment and over-the-air updates
5. **Development Builds**: Create development builds for testing with native functionality
6. **Consider Expo Router**: Evaluate benefits of migrating to file-based routing

## Tech Stack

- React Native
- Expo
- TypeScript
- React Navigation
- React Native Maps
- Expo Location
- AI services (simulated for MVP, could use OpenAI, Google AI, etc.)

## Cost Analysis

### Initial Development

- **MVP Development**: $15,000 - $30,000 (depending on complexity and features)
- **Design**: $3,000 - $5,000
- **Testing**: $2,000 - $4,000

### Ongoing Costs

- **Server Hosting**: $50 - $200/month (based on user traffic)
- **Database**: $20 - $100/month (based on data volume)
- **Map API**: $100 - $500/month (Google Maps, Mapbox, etc. based on usage)
- **AI Content Generation**:
  - Custom solution: $100 - $1,000/month (depending on volume)
  - OpenAI API: ~$0.02 per query x number of queries
- **Content Research/Curation**: $500 - $2,000/month (for high-quality information)
- **Maintenance & Updates**: $1,000 - $3,000/month

### Cost Reduction Strategies

1. **Start with smaller geographical areas** to limit initial content costs
2. **Cache AI-generated content** to reduce API calls
3. **Implement a content contribution system** allowing local experts to add information
4. **Use open-source maps** like OpenStreetMap to reduce API costs
5. **Prioritize features** based on user value vs. cost

## Monetization Strategy Options

### 1. Freemium Model (Recommended Initial Strategy)

- **Basic Features (Free)**:
  - Standard navigation
  - Limited POI information (basic facts)
  - Ad-supported experience
- **Premium Subscription ($4.99-$9.99/month)**:
  - Comprehensive historical/cultural content
  - Audio narrations
  - Offline access
  - Ad-free experience
  - Customized routes based on interests

**Pros**: Low barrier to entry, clear path to revenue, scalable
**Cons**: Requires significant value in premium offering

### 2. Partnership Model

- **Tourism Boards**: Revenue from regional tourism authorities to promote their areas
- **Cultural Institutions**: Museums, historical sites paying for enhanced listings
- **Local Businesses**: Recommendations for nearby restaurants, accommodations, experiences
- **Travel Companies**: Integration with booking platforms with affiliate commissions

**Pros**: Additional revenue beyond direct users, adds value to the experience
**Cons**: Requires business development effort, may affect perceived neutrality

### 3. Advertising Model

- **Contextual Ads**: Relevant to user location and interests
- **Sponsored POIs**: Highlighted attractions or businesses
- **Branded Routes**: Curated journeys sponsored by brands (e.g., "Van Gogh Route by [Sponsor]")

**Pros**: Can generate revenue with smaller user base
**Cons**: May negatively impact user experience if overdone

### 4. Data Monetization (with clear user consent)

- **Anonymized Travel Patterns**: Valuable for urban planning, tourism authorities
- **POI Popularity Metrics**: Insights for businesses and cultural sites

**Pros**: Secondary revenue stream
**Cons**: Privacy concerns, regulatory considerations

### 5. In-App Purchases

- **Specialized Content Packages**: City guides, themed routes (e.g., Art History, Culinary Experiences)
- **Premium Audio Tours**: Expert narrations by historians, local experts
- **Exclusive Content**: Special access to limited or in-depth information

**Pros**: Flexible pricing, allows users to pay only for content they want
**Cons**: Revenue may be inconsistent

## Market Analysis and User Growth Strategy
